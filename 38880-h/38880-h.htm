<h2><i>COMPILERS' PREFACE.</i></h2>


<p>The inestimable value of literature in supplying healthful
recreation, in opening the mind to larger views of life, and in
creating ideals that shall mold the spiritual nature, is conceded
now by every one who has intelligently considered the problems
of education. But the basis upon which literature shall be
selected and arranged is still a matter of discussion.</p>

<p>Chronology, race-correspondence, correlation, and ethical
training should all be recognized incidentally; but the main
purpose of the teacher of literature is to send children on into
life with a genuine love for good reading. To accomplish this,
three things should be true of the reading offered: first, it
should be <i>literature</i>; second, it should be literature of some
scope, not merely some small phase of literature, such as the
fables or the poetry of one of the less eminent poets; and third,
it should appeal to children's natural interests. Children's interests,
varied as they seem, center in the marvelous and the
preternatural; in the natural world; and in human life, especially
child life and the romantic and heroic aspects of mature
life. In the selections made for each grade, we have recognized
these different interests.</p>

<p>To grade poetry perfectly for different ages is an impossibility;
much of the greatest verse is for all ages&mdash;that is one
reason why it <i>is</i> great. A child of five will lisp the numbers of
Horatius with delight; and Scott's <i>Lullaby of an Infant Chief</i>,
with its romantic color and its exquisite human tenderness, is
dear to childhood, to manhood, and to old age. But the Land
of Song is a great undiscovered country to the little child; by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>some road or other he must find his way into it; and these volumes
simply attempt to point out a path through which he may
be led into its happy fields.</p>

<p>Our earnest thanks are due to the following publishers for
permission to use copyrighted poems: to Houghton, Mifflin &amp;
Co. for poems by Longfellow, Whittier, Emerson, Holmes,
Lowell, Aldrich, Bayard Taylor, James T. Fields, Ph&#339;be Cary,
Lucy Larcom, Celia Thaxter, and Sarah Orne Jewett; to D.
Appleton &amp; Co. for a large number of Bryant's poems; to
Charles Scribner's Sons for two poems by Stevenson, from
<i>Underwoods</i>, and <i>A Child's Garden of Verse</i>; to J. B. Lippincott
&amp; Co. for two poems by Thomas Buchanan Read; and to
Henry T. Coates &amp; Co. for a poem by Charles Fenno Hoffman.</p>

<p>The present volume is intended for the fourth, fifth, and sixth
school years, or lower grammar grades. It is the second of
three books prepared for use in the grades below the high
school. As no collection of this size can supply as much poetry
as may be used to advantage, and as many desirable poems by
American writers have necessarily been omitted, we have noted
at the end of this volume lists of poems which it would be well
to add to the material given here, that our children may realize
the scope and beauty of the poetry of their own land.</p>

<span class="i0">There was a rustling that seemed like a bustling,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little hands clapping and little tongues chattering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like fowls in a farmyard when barley is scattering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out came the children running:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the little boys and girls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if they were changed into blocks of wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unable to move a step, or cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the children merrily skipping by,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And could only follow with the eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That joyous crowd at the Piper's back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the Mayor was on the rack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wretched Council's bosoms beat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the Piper turned from the High Street<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where the Weser rolled its waters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right in the way of their sons and daughters!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However, he turned from south to west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after him the children pressed;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span><span class="i0">Great was the joy in every breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"He never can cross that mighty top!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's forced to let the piping drop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we shall see our children stop!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, lo! as they reached the mountain's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wondrous portal opened wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Piper advanced, and the children followed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when all were in to the very last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The door in the mountain side shut fast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did I say, all? No! one was lame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And could not dance the whole of the way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in after years, if you would blame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sadness, he was used to say,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"It's dull in our town since my playmates left!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can't forget that I'm bereft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the pleasant sights they see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which the Piper also promised me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joining the town and just at hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where waters gushed and fruit trees grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flowers put forth a fairer hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And everything was strange and new;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their dogs outran our fallow deer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And honeybees had lost their stings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And horses were born with eagles' wings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And just as I became assured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lame foot would be speedily cured,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The music stopped and I stood still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found myself outside the hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left alone against my will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To go now limping as before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never hear of that country more!"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The merry boats of Brixham<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Go out to search the seas;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stanch and sturdy fleet are they,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who love a swinging breeze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And before the woods of Devon,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the silver cliffs of Wales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may see, when summer evenings fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The light upon their sails.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But when the year grows darker,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And gray winds hunt the foam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They go back to Little Brixham,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And ply their toil at home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus it chanced one winter's night,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When a storm began to roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all the men were out at sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And all the wives on shore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then as the wind grew fiercer,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The women's cheeks grew white,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was fiercer in the twilight,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And fiercest in the night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strong clouds set themselves like ice,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Without a star to melt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blackness of the darkness<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Was darkness to be felt.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The old men they were anxious,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What do you think the women did?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Love taught them what to do!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out spake a wife, "We've beds at home,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We'll burn them for a light,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give us the men and the bare ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We want no more to-night."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They took the grandame's blanket,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They took the baby's pillow,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who could not say them no;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they heaped a great fire on the pier,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And knew not all the while<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If they were heaping a bonfire,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or only a funeral pile.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And fed with precious food, the flame<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shone bravely on the black,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till a cry rang through the people,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"A boat is coming back!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Staggering dimly through the fog<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Come shapes of fear and doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the first prow strikes the pier,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Cannot you hear them shout?<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then all along the breath of flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dark figures shrieked and ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With "Child, here comes your father!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or, "Wife, is this your man?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And faint feet touch the welcome shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And wait a little while;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kisses drop from frozen lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Too tired to speak or smile.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, one by one, they struggled in<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All that the sea would spare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We will not reckon through our tears<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The names that were not there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But some went home without a bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When all the tale was told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who were too cold with sorrow<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To know the night was cold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And this is what the men must do<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who work in wind and foam;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this is what the women bear<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who watch for them at home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So when you see a Brixham boat<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Go out to face the gales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think of the love that travels<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like light upon her sails.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas moonset at starting; but while we drew near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Boom, a great yellow star came out to see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At D&uuml;ffield, 'twas morning as plain as could be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from Mecheln church steeple we heard half the chime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, Joris broke silence with, "Yet there is time!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At Aershot, up leaped of a sudden the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And against him the cattle stood black every one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stare thro' the mist at us galloping past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With resolute shoulders, each butting away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one eye's black intelligence,&mdash;ever that glance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the thick heavy spume flakes which aye and anon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By Hasselt, Dirck groaned; and cried Joris, "Stay spur!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your Roos galloped bravely, the fault's not in her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll remember at Aix"&mdash;for one heard the quick wheeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her chest, saw the stretched neck and staggering knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, we were left galloping, Joris and I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The broad sun above laughs a pitiless laugh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Neath our feet broke the brittle bright stubble like chaff;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till over by Dalhem a dome spire sprang white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And "Gallop," gasped Joris, "for Aix is in sight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How they'll greet us!"&mdash;and all in a moment his roan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the news which alone could save Aix from her fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with circles of red for his eye sockets' rim.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then I cast loose my buff coat, each holster let fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shook off both my jack boots, let go belt and all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called my Roland his pet name, my horse without peer;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad or good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and stood.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And all I remember is, friends flocking round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I sat with his head 'twixt my knees on the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was no more than his due who brought good news from Ghent.<br /></span>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
